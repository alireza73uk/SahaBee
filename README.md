# SahaBee [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/emran.bm/sahabee/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/emran.bm/sahabee/-/commits/master)  
A simple api for rollcalling during the remote-work.
## What's the problem?
In [Sahab](https://www.sahab.ir) we are remote working because of the corona virus. These days it's a regular task for us to report our work-times to the company every 5 day.
## What does SahaBee do?
I found it boring to fill a timesheet excel every time; so decided to develop a small (yet not powerfull!) API to just call it and get the reports automatically.
